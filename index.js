// VARIABLES:

let name = "Aditya";
console.log(name);

// Cannot be a reserved keyword
// Should be meaningful
// Cannot start with a number (1name)
// Cannot contain a space or hyphen(-)
// Are case-sensitive

let firstName = "Aditya";
let lastName = "Upadhye";

// CONTANTS

let interestRate = 0.3;
interestRate = 1;
console.log(interestRate);

// In this case, 1 will be printed.
// Using `let`, the variable value can be changed later by decaring it again.
// If you want to make the variable that should not change later, use `const`.
